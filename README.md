> Above: Use `npx asari` in your shell to manage your work in GitHub.

"Asari" („ÅÇ„Åï„Çä) is [Japanese for "clam"](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=ja&text=clam). Like a clam, `asari` is happiest when it's inside a shell.

`asari` lets you work with GitHub from your command line, and is delicious when lightly fried with garlic and spices.

## Installation

### Global installation (recommmended)

```bash
npm install --global asari
```

When you run the tool, it will automatically notify you if there is a newer version of it available for you to update to.

[You can disable notifications](https://www.npmjs.com/package/update-notifier#user-settings) if you'd prefer not to be notified about updates.

### No installation

```bash
npx asari
```

The `npx` command lets you use this tool without installing it. However, each time you use `npx` it downloads the whole package from the npm registry, which takes a while. That's why global installation is reccommended.

> Note: If this tool is globally installed, `npx asari` will use that globally installed version rather than downloading.

asari <command>

```bash
export $GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=[your token here]
```

# Developers

## Command hierarchy and directory structure

This project loosely follows the example provided in the Yargs documentation for command hierarchy and directory structure.

- @see: https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#commanddirdirectory-opts
- @see: [`bin/asari.js`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/asari/blob/master/bin/asari.js) for the root `asari` command.
- @see: [`src/commands`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/asari/blob/master/src/commands/) for the `asari <command>` commands.

## Conventions

### CamelCase, hyphen-case and under_scores

- All yargs commands and filenames are in `hyphen-case`.
- All function names and variables are in `camelCase`.
- The parameters used by Octokit are in `under_score` format.

### Code formatting and linting

- The [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/Financial-Times/asari/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) file contains the settings for code linting.

  - @see: https://eslint.org/

- Consider installing `eslint` in your editor. Plugins are available for most popular editors.

  - @see: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors

- Note: `.eslintrc.js` extends the `prettier` tool, which applies code formatting rules.

  - @see: https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html

- You can `npm run eslint-check` to check there are no conflicts between eslint and prettier configurations.

  - @see: https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#cli-helper-tool

- The `prettier` tool uses the "@adambraimbridge/prettierrc-2019-05" configuration.

  - @see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adambraimbridge/prettierrc-2019-05

- Consider installing `prettier` in your editor. Plugins are available for most popular editors.
